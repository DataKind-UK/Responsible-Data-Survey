1,Positive,"Data and AI are two different things. Data can be turned into knowledge and that is overwhelmingly positive.

 Other things that concern me: 
 Commercial exploiters will be desperate to take ""good enough"" algorithms to market and the field may be held back by resistance to innovation, once they're making a lot of money. Users (as opposed to designers) may apply models trained for one scenario to inappropriate use-cases and discredit the technology when it fails and perhaps causes injury. More generally, machine intelligence failures will grab more headlines than successes, and this may hold back progress. Finally, I worry slightly that we're not planning enough (or maybe we are and I'm just not aware) - I'm not greatly worried about the ""grey goo"" dangers (though such fears are not outlandish) but more that we seem a bit obsessed with the idea of an autonomous thinking machine that can do everything itself - a contained intelligence, similar to individual humans - when (surely) the intelligence can more usefully reside in the web/network/internet/Culture, with relatively dumb machines doing the practical tasks we find difficult or dangerous (lifting heavy objects, defusing mines, etc).",5,1,4,5,5,4,2,3,Other/Mixed,"Developers and regulators.

The items I've marked ""unsure"" are where they might be relevant, depending on the project, except for the ""underrepresented group"" one where I am genuinely unsure!
 
 I'm working on the assumption of course that this micro-finance non-profit is a charitable enterprise trying to do good, rather than a loan business trying to make money; in the latter case credit history is of the first importance, in the former I decided after some thought it's irrelevant.","Use of AI is moving at about the right pace, with a balance between protecting against risk and embracing opportunities","This is the sort of question it's almost impossible to answer without the viewpoint of hindsight, but from my own experience of AI research and development I think we're not failing badly.","worried, concerned, thoughtful, responsible, cautious",Yes,"Almost any development could be used in a harmful way, eg face recognition technology could be used to spot protesters against a regime, bomb disposal robots could be used to plant bombs, etc...
